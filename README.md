<h1>Overview</h1>

This project aims to add an innovative twist to traditional groomsmen gifts with personalization and now opportunity to share their gift as a piece of art. I wanted to really show my groomsmen how much they mean to me so I knew I had to make something. I decided to make a 3D playing card after getting inspired by Max Novak’s video where he made a 3d playing card using the program blender. From his video I was able to construct the outline of the playing card box. Then was the hard part…designing, this was a tedious process but a satisfying one because I was able to enjoy old memories shared with each of my groomsmen for inspiration for their design. Each card is specially made towards each groomsmen hobbies, likes, strengths and weakness. Once I had each of their playing cards done it was time to create their avatars, I was able to generate an avatar that would then be eligible to become animated with adobe mixamo through a site called Ready Player Me. Once uploaded, I was able to then save the t-shirts template and photoshop the design I already made for their physical shirts so their avatars can match them. Once I made added the templates it was time to use blender and the camera features in order to make render videos from it. Once they were all done to my liking it was time to export them and add them on the blockchain. There are many platforms to choose from but I chose Rarible. Through Rarible I was able to connect to my ethereum wallet with the extension of Metamask(decentralized/Web3 wallet), to then upload each NFT with their respectable descriptions. Once all the NFTs were uploaded on the blockchain, I wanted my groomsmen to be able to demonstrate their new gifts. One of my groomsmen, Chris, writes music and has his music out in many platforms and I wanted his work to be elevated as well, so I made 250 QR stickers that when scanned it will direct you to a link tree with links that either take you to his music or where their NFTs are displayed for them to be shown for everyone to see and enjoy. The letters TCP stands for The Crypto Palette which is a website I am working on right now to educate and inform newcomers and people already in the space as the community is constantly growing and I want to help onboard as many people as possible.
